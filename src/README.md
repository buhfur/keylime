This is a readme for what this branch is about, and what I was trying to accomplish 

Goal: Create an API that can generate data for garble

My purpose in doing this was for the reasons of adding the infinite mode API to the GarbleWeb Javascript game 
that's hosted on github pages. 


I successfully managed to genrate the data needed for the application, however I did not have security in mind 
when writing this therefore, this code is kind of a mess. 

There is no documentation for any of this stuff and quite frankly, I don't think I will ever finish it for sanity 
reasons but who knows.
